# HR-Analytics-Tableau-Dashboard

Designing and developing an HR analytics dashboard in Tableau using a sample Excel data file. It covers data preparation, KPI creation, chart development, and dashboard design. 

The goal is to provide a visually appealing and insightful tool for HR decision-making based on Attrition, Education, and Employee Age Group.

About Data: The data used in this dashboard is a dummy dataset with 1500 rows and 30-40 columns.
KPI creation: The video shows how to create key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total headcount, attrition rate, and department-wise attrition.
Chart creation: The video demonstrates how to create various charts, including a pie chart, bar chart, and heat map.
